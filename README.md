🏠 House Price Prediction Dataset:

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict house prices based on various input features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, furnishing status, location, and more. It uses data-driven techniques to assist users, buyers, or real estate companies in estimating the fair price of a house.

📊 About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains *2000 rows* of structured data on house listings. Each row represents a property with multiple attributes that affect its price. This data is ideal for regression analysis and predictive modeling tasks.

 ⭐ Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and encoding
- Model training and evaluation (Linear Regression, etc.)
- Visualization of predicted vs actual results
- Exporting the model for future predictions.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- *Python 3.x*
- *Pandas* – for data manipulation
- *NumPy* – for numerical operations
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* – for data visualization
- *Scikit-learn* – for machine learning models and preprocessing
- *Jupyter/Colab* or *VS Code* – for development environment
